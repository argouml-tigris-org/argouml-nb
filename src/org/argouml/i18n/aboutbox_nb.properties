		How to report bugs.\n\
		\n\
		As in many software applications, some bugs do exist in ArgoUML.  There are also features that don't function correctly, and there is strange behavior occurring in the application.  Some of these bugs have been found, others have not.\n\
		\n\
		To make sure that the problems you find are known to the ArgoUML project, do the following:\n\
		\n\
		1.  Visit the project web site at http://argouml.tigris.org.\n\
		\n\
		2.  Register as a member on Tigris if you haven't already done so.\n\
		\n\
		3.  Request the Observer role in the project if you haven't already done so.\n\
		\n\
		4.  Go to Issuezilla (Bugs and Issues).\n\
		\n\
		5.  Search for the bug in the database.\n\
		\n\
		6.  If a search reveals that the bug exists, add the special observations you have made and add yourself as a cc to the Issue, and you are done.  On the other hand, if you can't find the bug, create a new issue.\n\
		\n\
		7.  When creating a new issue or adding information to an existing Issue be sure to include:\n\
		-+- what version of the application you are running,\n\
		-+- what version of the jdk or jre you're using,\n\
		-+- all the "relevant" steps that lead up to this,\n\
		-+- the test case you ran (if any),\n\
		-+- what you expected to happen as a result of this test case,\n\
		-+- what actually happens, and\n\
		-+- what you believe the problem to be.\n\
		\n\
		8.  If the problem is repeatable, rerun the application with debug logging enabled (java -Dlog4j.configuration=org/argouml/resource/full.lcf -jar argouml.jar) and add the log file argo_full.log to the issue.\n\
		\n\
		9.  Add extra information that might be relevant for the issue as attachments.  These could be screen shots, your project file, log files...\n\
		Don't forget that the ArgoUML is a very open project so if you have trade secrets or other sensible information you must screen these objects before adding them.\n\
		\n\
		10. You will get updates via mail when someone comments or does something with your issue.\n\
		\n\
		11. When the issue you created or have encountered is resolved and verified, close it after you have accepted the solution.\n\
		\n\
		By following the above steps, you are making an important contribution to the ArgoUML project. Your help will make it possible to make ArgoUML a better product. If you want to help even more, by investigating and fixing the problems, you are most welcome.  Start by reading the Chapter 1 in the Cookbook.
